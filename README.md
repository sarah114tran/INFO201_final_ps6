### Description 
* For my final project, I have selected global temperature data collected by the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). To collect the data, the university uses satellites to capture the temperature from regions all over the world, even in areas that are difficult to reach. The data set contains 14310 observations and the 4 following variables: year, month, region, and temperature. The data quality is excellent and does not contain any missing values. 

### Plot 
* Under the "Plot" tab, I use a scatter-line plot to display the average temperature of each month in the given year. Each point on the graph displays the average temperature of the month and an additional line helps the user visualize how the temperature trend changes through the year. Using the widgets in the side panel, the user has several options to change the data being displayed and how it will be displayed. The first set of radio buttons on the widget allows the user to change the color of the plot. The second widget is a drop down bar that allows the user to select the type of plot used to display the data. The two options are a scatter plot and a bar plot. The last set of radio buttons on the widget allows the users to select and filter the data for a certain year. 

### Table
* Under the "Table" tab, it displays the values in the data table. The drop-down widget in the side panel allows for the user to filter the data set based on region. For example, if the user selects "nh", it will display only the data for the "nh"" region.
